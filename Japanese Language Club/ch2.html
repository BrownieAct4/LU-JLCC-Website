                <p>Notice the words that include "がく." This is the suffix for many education-related words or fields of study. The kanji is 学.</p>

            <h2>Grammar and Particles</h2>
            <p>Particles are used to mark parts of a sentence.</p>
            <div class="rmiddle">
                <h3>The は Particle</h3>
            </div>
            <p>It's time to start using full sentences.</p>
            <p>The first sentence structure is very simple:</p>
            <p class="big">X は Y です<br>X is Y<br>(lit. "X, Y is")</p>
            <p>The word です is the verb "to be." There is no conjugation here, dictionary forms of Japanese words are how they're used in present tense. Verbs are always placed at the end of a Japanese sentence.</p>
            <div class="noteR">
                <p>English sentences are constructed using "subject, verb, object" structures. Japanese sentences are constructed using "subject, object, verb" structures. So the sentence "I went to the store" in English becomes "I, to the store, went" in Japanese.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The character は in this context is a particle marker, used for identifying the subject (or the topic) in a sentence. This means that it's marking the word that comes before it (in this case "X") as the subject. While it is normally pronounced "ha," it is pronounced as "wa" if it is used as a particle. The phrase 私は (watashi wa) tells us that the sentence is about the speaker (me, I).</p>
            <!-- MAKE NOTE ABOUT HOW THERE ISN'T ANY A, AN, OR THE
            EXPLAIN "REGARDING _____" -->
            <div class="note rmiddle">
                <p>Read the following dialogue:<br>A: それは何ですか？<br>B: これはペンです。<br></p>
            </div>
            <div class="rmiddle">
                <h3>The も Particle</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Read the following:</p>
            <p class="big">XもYです<br>X is also Y</p>
            <p>Notice anything different? The は has been replaced with the particle も. This changes the meaning of the sentence. While は marked the subject, も marks the subject AND says "also." Therefor, the meaning changes from "X is Y" to "X is also Y."</p>
            <div class="note rmiddle">
                <p>Read the following dialogue:<br>A: あおはいろです<br>B: あかもいろです</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rmiddle">
                <h3>The の Particle</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Look at the following sentence:</p>
            <p class="big">これは私の本です</p>
            <p>Let's break down this sentence and find out what this means:<br>If you look closely, you can see that the "XはYです" sentence structure is still there. There are three parts to this sentence: subject, object, and verb. We are already familiar with the subject (これ) and the verb (です), but the object in the sentece consists of a compound of 私, の, and 本. The の in this compound indicates possession. Whatever is on the left of the の (私) is the owner of whatever is on the right side (本). This means that the object of the sentence is "my book," or 私の本. Putting the sentence together, it says, "This is my book."</p>

                <h3>The Negation</h3>
            </div>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>日本語</th>
                    <th>English</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>食べる<br>食べます</td>
                    <td>to eat</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>会う<br>会います</td>
                    <td>to meet; to meet up with</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>japanese</td>
                    <td>english</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The negation of a verb is to "not do" something or "don't" do something. The negation of <i>running</i>, for example, is <i>not running</i>. Conjugating a Japanese verb into its negation is simple. Take the ～ます at the end of the verb and replace it with ～ません.</p>

            <h1>Level 1</h1>
            <p>This first level will consist of a range of common expressions and sentences used in general conversation with some notes about sentence structure. We will also discuss some cultural aspects of the language and the three writing styles used.</p>
            <h2>Understanding the<br>Japanese Language</h2>
            <p>The difference between English and Japanese as forms of communicating is quite large. It is estimated that an English speaker will take around three times as many hours to learn Japanese than it would to learn Spanish. The reason for this is because Japanese not only has multiple unique writing systems, but the language was isolated for centuries which prevented it from creating many similarities with other languages until after World War II.</p>
            
            <h2>Common Expressions</h2>
            <p>Japanese words written using letters from the Latin alphabet are called "Romaji" and are meant to help new students learn words before being able to read Japanese characters. You should prioritize learning kana (simple Japanese characters) right away.</p>
            <div class="rmiddle">
                <h3>Everyday Expressions</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Notice that each question ends with the character "ka." This is like a question mark at the end of a sentence.</p>
            <div class="note">
                <p>Long vowels occur when there are two vowels with similar sounds next to each other in a word. The word <i>kuuki</i> is not pronounced "kuki," but the <i>u</i> sound is elongated twice as long to account for both instances of the sound. Therefor, it is pronounced "kuuki.
                "</p>
                <p>Another note about vowels is when the characters <i>o</i> and <i>u</i> are placed together (ex. <i>douzo</i>). If <i>u</i> comes after <i>o</i>, it elongates the <i>o</i> sound instead of making the <i>u</i> sound. Therefore, <i>douzo</i> is pronounced "doozo" instead of "do-uzo".</p>

            </table>
            <div class="note">
                <p>You may notice in the sentence "watashi wa genki desu" that the "watashi wa" is optional. This is because the context of who the sentence is about is usually inferred and can be omitted from the whole sentence. Thus, it becomes "am well" which makes sense when spoken in Japanese because the subject of the conversation is already understood.</p>

            </div>
            <p>When speaking about or to someone, honorifics are used. These suffixes are placed at the end of someone's name to signify respect or hierarchy. In English, we have Mr., Ms., Mrs., and Prof., but Japanese uses more honorifics to address people in different contexts. These work in the same way, but at the end of the name instead of before.</p>
            <p>These are some of the most common honorifics:</p>

            </div>
            <p>Verbs have two common forms: casual and formal. Casual forms of these verbs are used when with friends and others close to you. These forms always end with an "u" character (u, ku, bu, tsu, ru, mu, etc.). The formal forms of verbs end in with "masu" (pronounced <i>moss</i>) and are used when speaking respectfully to teachers, bosses, etc. If you're not sure which to use, it's typically safe to stick with the formal.</p>
            <div class="noteR">
                <p>The verb <i>desu</i> is an irregular verb, meaning that it is conjugated differently. In this instance, it is already in its dictionary form and its formal form. The casual form is simply <i>da</i>.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The casual forms are also called the dictionary form, meaning that they are how they're found in the dictionary, you will not find the formal (masu) form in the dictionary. The formal form is also called the "~masu" form. Both forms are provided here. Later on, you will learn how to take the dictionary form of a verb and convert it into its "masu" form.</p>
            <p>Lastly, you'll notice that some words that start with the character for <i>o</i> will be in parentheses. This is because it makes the word an honorific, meaning it is respectful. Don't worry about it too hard, just memorize the words as they're written with the <i>o</i>.</p>

            <h2>Kana & Kanji</h2>
            <p>Kana are simple characters used in the Japanese language. Both hiragana and katakana contain 46 currently used characters each. Hiragana are rounded characters and katakana are blocky characters, Kanji are a combination of both and typically take more strokes to write.</p>
            <div class="rmiddle">
                <h3>Hiragana</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Hiragana are the common kana used for many Japanese words. You may find children's books (and Pokemon games) are written purely in kana and don't use kanji (complex Japanese characters).</p>
            <div class="cmiddle">
                <img src="images/hiragana.png">
            </div>
            <div class="rmiddle">
                <h3>Katakana</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Katakana are the less common kana that are typically used when spellng foreign words, borrowed from other languages. Many of these foreign words are taken from English, so watch out for familiar-sounding words. You may have noticed the word <i>teeburu</i> sounded like the English <i>table</i>. In this case, <i>teeburu</i> is, in fact, written using katakana because it is a word borrowed from a foreign language. You will find that a lot of food-related words are also borrowed from English.</p>

            <div class="rmiddle">
                <h3>Kanji</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Kanji are the complex characters borrowed from Chinese. Most are used in various words and pronounced in different ways depending on the context. There are a total of ~50,000 kanji in the Japanese language. Luckily for learners, only a fraction of that list comprises the majority of the language. Using only the Jouyou kanji (top 2,136 most used kanji), you can read almost anything in Japanese and still have an understanding of the content.</p>

            <h1>Home</h1>
            <p>Hello. This is the official website dedicated to helping Liberty University students learn Japanese in order to grow in their abilities and progress through each level of study. The navigation on the right side will take you to the different levels of study based on the course curriculum offered by the club. Feel free to start from the beginning and find what level of learning you are.</p>

            <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
            <p>This site is designed to be easy to use and chronologically ordered, so there should be little problem navigating the pages. There are, however, some aspects that should be explained.</p>
            <div class="noteR">
                <p>This is a "note box." It is used to make little notes about the current study material to help you understand more about the content.</p>
            </div>
            <p>A green Note box can occassionally be found (read its contents to find out what it's for). They can offer contexts or further understandings to help you get a better grasp on the content taught.</p>
            <p class="big">This is a "grammar box" used to tell you about new grammar points.</p>
            <p>Each chapter will contain sections on vocabulary, grammar, sentence structure, expressions, culture, etc.</p>

            <h2>Memorization</h2>
            <p>In order to maximize your ability to learn and memorize the vocabulary and expressions found in this course, it's important to include each new item into a flashcard deck that you can review whenever you have free time. As professor Tuzi says, just ten minutes of practice each day is enough to keep you in the game.</p>

            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>The "Resources" page contains a list of helpful material to help you learn. Each available link will send you to another page that provides information based on what you're looking for. This can be grammar, listening, and flashcard help as recommended by the club and others.</p>
            <p>Learning a language is almost impossible with only one resource, so make sure to diversify your language input and understanding.</p>
